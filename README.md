# ✍️ Margin

> *"Sometimes, it’s the things written in the margins that matter most."*

**Margin** is a clean, responsive platform designed for writers, storytellers, and creatives to share their words — their way. Built using **Bootstrap**, this project began with a little sarcasm and evolved into a full-fledged space where content takes center stage.

## 🌟 About the Project

They say first impressions matter — mine was calling it *Boots-crap* 🤦‍♀️  
Turns out, Bootstrap had the last laugh.

What started as a playful jab turned into a passion project during one of those post-project lulls where stray ideas quietly stitch themselves into something real. I wanted to create:

- A **minimalist**, distraction-free interface
- A place where **stories, poems, and blogs** could breathe
- A responsive layout that works beautifully across devices

Thus, **Margin** was born — a second chance for both an underestimated framework and the ideas we scribble on the side.
